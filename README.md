# expression-profiling-app
The Gene Expression Profiling App displays the snRNA-seq data and the corresponding results of the research published in the paper "Single cell multiomic profiling of human lung reveals cell type-specific and age-dynamic control of SARS-CoV2 host genes (https://elifesciences.org/articles/62522)" in the form of various plots like dot plot, heatmap and correlation plot. The user can visualize the Average Expression as well as the Percent Expression of their gene of choice across different cell types, ages and samples, as well as customize attributes to enrich their experience.
